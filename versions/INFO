Pulsar search: active : v3
SP search : active : v2
v4 : Version before the without GPU (no heimdall)
v5:: Version with PRESTO and single_pulse_search.py package.
v6: A good working verion but does not remove zero DM candidates. Next version. 
V7 : With PRESTO, removes zerodm candidates (Next version should have ploting based on the candidate DM and SNR)
V8 : Copy before cleaning and better plotting tool
V9 : Better plot with DM vs SNR plot 
V10: Heimdall command improved with rfi_no_narrow placed (active)


PlotCand: active v1
v1: Basic version
v2: With improve diagnostic plot 
v3 : Also with DM vs phase 
v4: Fixed a bug with candidate found at the edge of the file, copied this for next version with negative DM
plots
v5 : Save copy before centing pulse change 
v6: Centering pulse such that we only need to see one plot.(Did not work, very well) (active)
v7: Save before a new version which is to use new python module to plot (without DSPSR and PSRCHIVE).  

SPANDAK is a bigger wrapper which will SP_search_BL or other inside
The reason to have a separate wrapper is to do negative DM search enable.
v1: Version which can do both sub-band search and neg-DM but not both together.  

waterfaller_vg_v1.py : basic
waterfaller_vg_v2.py : DM-vs-time plot uses original data while waterfall and time-series uses downsampled data. 
waterfaller_vg_v3.py : DM-vs-time uses subbanded and downsample data. The zooming on the pulse is fixed to be width*128 bins. 
waterfaller_vg_v4.py : Added on-pulse spectra on the side of the dedisperse waterfall along with a t-test comparison with off-pulse spectra. 
                       Also added DM-vs-SNR for the on-pulse and off-pulse region. The plots are much better. 
    			The only thing I want to add is zoom on the DM-vs-SNR region based on the Cordes and MacLaughlin paper's 
			equation number 13.
